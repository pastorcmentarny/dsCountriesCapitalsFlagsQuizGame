    <string name="about_program_text">ABOUT GAME:\n
    This game was created as part of \'weekend challenge\'.\n
    See my blog about how challenge looked and how to make simple game as this one.\n
    Link: http://pastorcmentarny.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/how-to-make-simple-game-in-android-part.html\n
    It is simple causal quiz game where user can guess countries, capitals, flag or continents .\n
    Idea for this game came to me during developing Doms learning chinese game ,
    where i added few mini lesson will be about countries capitals continents and etc as i discover flags will
    occupy too much spaces, so i made this.. independent game.

    ABOUT GAME ACCURACY:\n
    ** This game is NOT political correct! **\n
    *\t I made decisions quite randomly and they are not necessary based on my believes.\n
    *\t List of countries based extended version of what UN consider as country and partly ISO-3316-1 standard.\n
    I included for example England,Scotland and Wales.\n
    *\t Few countries are trans-continental as they are between 2 continents. For Egypt, Russia and Turkey both
    continents are consider as correct.
    Rest countries a signed to specific continent (That cover 95% or more).\n
    *\t Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia,Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore lies on the border of Oceania and Asia.\n
    As there is few version about which country belong to which region, I arbitrarily make decision that all of them
    are asian countries.\n
    *\t Some capitals has * in the end,this is due some issue to related define capital of that country (for example
    South Africa has 3 capitals,where Nauru does not have a capital) .\n
    *\t Please look to country\'s info in Countries Info in main menu for details information about capitals of these
    countries.\n
    *\t I tried to make sure that all information are as correct as possible,but if YOU find a mistake.Let me know.I
    will correct them as soon as possible.\n
    Thank you in advance.\n
